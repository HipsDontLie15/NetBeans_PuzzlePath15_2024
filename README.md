## üìí Description

A family-friendly NetBeans game designed for kids to enhance problem-solving and critical thinking skills, built using OOP principles. Developed as part of a Visual Programming course during my Bachelor of Computer Science, using Apache NetBeans.

The game is a number puzzle, where players must sort numbers in ascending order (from 1 to 15) within a grid layout. It features 3 difficulty levels and a demo gameplay mode. The interface includes start and pause buttons, allowing players to begin the game when ready or take breaks.

phpMyAdmin is used for sign-up/login functionality, storing player scores in a simple scoreboard. The scoreboard tracks the username, best completion time, number of moves taken, and the date/time of play, inspired by classic arcade games. Players can compete based on their performance.
